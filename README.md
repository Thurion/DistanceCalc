## Installation

1. On EDMC's Plugins settings tab press the _Open_ button. This reveals the _plugins_ folder where EDMC looks for plugins.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Thurion/DistanceCalc/releases).
3. Open the _.zip_ archive that you downloaded and move the _DistanceCalc_ folder contained inside into the _plugins_ folder.

You will need to re-start EDMC for it to notice the new plugin.

## Usage

You can add up to three systems or points in the settings. Non valid entries (e.g. x, y or z is empty) won't be stored when you close the settings.
It is possible to clear an entire row by pressing the _Clear_ button. The _EDSM_ button fills in the coordinates for a system providing the system name can be found on EDSM.
Once at least one system/point has been added in the settings, the main window shows the distance from your current location to those systems/points in light years.

Further more it is possible to display the travelled distance. The plugin uses the distance provided by the journal files for the calculation. 
The _total distance_ is stored and is available even when the program is closed. Uncheck the option if you don't want to your jumps added to it. This also causes it to be hidden from the main window. To reset it, press the button underneath it.
The travelled distance for the current session has two available options:
* Calculate it for the current EDSM session: Add distances as long as EDSM runs
* Calculate it for the current Elite Session: Add distances as long as you don't load into Elite or close EDSM
